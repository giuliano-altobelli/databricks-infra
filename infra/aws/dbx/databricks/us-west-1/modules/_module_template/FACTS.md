# Facts Ledger (Docs → Durable Facts)

Use this file to keep retrieved documentation out of chat context.

Rules:

- Record only the minimum durable facts needed to implement the module.
- Prefer 1–2 lines per fact; do not paste large doc blocks.
- Always include a source pointer you can re-fetch later.
  - Terraform Registry: provider/resource docs page
  - Context7: library id + query topic (so it can be re-run)

## Facts

| Area | Item | Fact (short) | Source | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| resource | `databricks_*` |  | registry: `databricks/databricks` |  |
| argument | `foo` |  | registry / context7 | required/optional, defaults |
| gotcha |  |  | issue / release notes | behavior edge case |
